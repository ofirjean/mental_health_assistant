🔹 The Full Cycle
1. Code

You (or your team) write code for the application (Flask, frontend, DB configs, etc.).

This code lives in your GitLab application repo (the “source code” repo).

2. GitLab

You push your changes (git push) to GitLab.

This triggers your CI pipeline in Jenkins.

3. Jenkins (CI)

Jenkins builds the Docker image of your app using the code from GitLab.
Example: docker build -t ofirjean/app:v0.1.5 .

Jenkins pushes that image to Docker Hub (or another registry).

Then Jenkins updates the GitOps repo with the new image tag in the Kubernetes manifests (YAML/Helm).

e.g., deployment.yaml goes from v0.1.4 → v0.1.5

Jenkins commits and pushes that change into GitLab (but this time, into your GitOps repo).

4. Docker Hub

Holds your built image: ofirjean/app:v0.1.5

Kubernetes will later pull this image when ArgoCD applies the updated manifests.

5. GitOps Repo

This is a separate GitLab repo (the one you connected with ArgoCD).

It doesn’t hold source code, only Kubernetes YAMLs or Helm charts that describe the desired state of your app.

Jenkins edits this repo (to update the image tag), then commits → push.

This repo becomes the single source of truth for deployments.

6. ArgoCD (CD)

ArgoCD continuously watches the GitOps repo.

When Jenkins pushes a new manifest (e.g. updated image tag), ArgoCD notices the difference.

ArgoCD syncs the change → applies the YAMLs/Helm charts into Kubernetes.

7. Kubernetes

The cluster reconciles the new manifests.

It pulls the new image from Docker Hub.

Deployments roll out new pods (blue/green or rolling update).

Old pods terminate once new ones are ready.

Your application is live with the updated version. 🎉

🔹 Visual Flow
[ Code ] 
   ↓ push
[ GitLab (source repo) ]
   ↓ CI trigger
[ Jenkins CI ] ───> [ Docker Hub (images) ]
   │
   └──> updates → [ GitOps Repo (YAMLs/Helm) ]
                     ↓
              [ ArgoCD (CD) ]
                     ↓
              [ Kubernetes Cluster ]

🔹 Why this cycle is powerful

Automation → no manual kubectl apply needed.

Auditability → every deployment is a Git commit in the GitOps repo (history, rollbacks).

Separation of concerns:

Devs work on app repo

Ops/Infra team manages manifests in GitOps repo

Reliability → ArgoCD ensures the cluster state always matches Git.
